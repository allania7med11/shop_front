## Environment Configuration

This section provides information about the environment configuration for this project.

### Environment Variables

This project uses a `.env` file to configure its environment. You can create a `.env` file in the project root directory and set the following environment variables:

- `ENVIRONMENT`: Specifies the current environment (e.g., 'debug', 'dev', 'prod').
- `PORT`: Defines the port on which the application will listen.

Make sure to update these values to match your specific environment configuration. You can check `.env.example` for reference.

## Running the Project

To run the project using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the project repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/allania7med11/shop_back/
    cd shop_back
    ```

2. **Environment Configuration**: Create a `.env` file with the necessary environment variables. You can use the provided `.env.example` as a template. Make sure to update the values to match your specific environment configuration.

3. **Build and Start Containers**: Run the following command to build and start the Docker containers using Docker Compose:

    ```shell
    docker-compose up -d

    The `-d` flag runs the containers in the background.

4. **Access the Application**: Once the containers are up and running, you can access the application in your web browser or by making API requests, depending on your project.

5. **Stopping the Containers**: To stop the containers when you're done, you can use the following command:

    ```shell
    docker-compose down
    ```

    This will stop and remove the containers.
